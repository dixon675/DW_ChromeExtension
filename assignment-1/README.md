# 8-BIT CHROME EXTENSION

This extension is intended to play with nostalgia for older gamers by taking a webside and making it "8-bit." The extension replaces the font with a pixelated one, reminiscient of Super Mario Bros. It also takes any images on the page and pixelates them, giving the page a very 8-bit feel.


### Inspiration
From the start of the project I knew I wanted to change the images and font to give the website a new identity. The decision to try for a pixelated 8-bit look came from a recent YouTube video I stumbled across which was showing off a fan remake of Castlevania with the original pixelated graphics, but from a first person perspective rather than the traditional side-scroller.
